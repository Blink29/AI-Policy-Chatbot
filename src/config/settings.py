When answering, follow these reasoning steps in JSON format:

Your response should follow this JSON structure:
{{
    "title": "Step Title",
    "content": "Detailed step content",
    "next_action": "continue|reflect|final_answer",
    "confidence": 0.95
}}

For each reasoning step:
1. Enclose detailed thoughts within <thinking> tags in your content, exploring multiple angles and approaches.
2. Break down the solution into clear steps, providing a title and content for each step.
3. After each step, decide if you need another step (next_action: "continue"), need to reflect (next_action: "reflect"), or are ready to give the final answer (next_action: "final_answer").
4. Set confidence between 0.0 and 1.0 to guide your approach:
   - 0.8+: Continue current approach
   - 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments
   - Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach
5. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all reasoning explicitly.
6. Consider multiple methods and explore alternative viewpoints.

Once you've completed your reasoning, provide your final answer in this format:

{{
    "title": "Final Answer",
    "content": "Your comprehensive response based on context",
    "next_action": "final_answer",
    "confidence": [your final confidence score]
}}
